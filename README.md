           Select the branches you want to merge changes from and into.
           Add a title and description for the pull request.
           Click "Create pull request".

           Reviewing a  pull request:

            Go to the "Pull requests" tab in the repository.
            Select the pull request to review.
            Review the changes by looking at the diffs.
            Add comments or suggestions on specific lines of code.
            Approve or request changes.

GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
        Answers
        GitHub Actions is a feature that allows you to automate workflows for your projects, such as building, testing, and deploying code

Introduction to Visual Studio:

What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?
            Answers 
            Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft used for developing applications, websites, web services, and mobile apps.

             Features

                       Watch Windows: Monitor variables and expressions.
                       Immediate Window: Execute commands and expressions at runtime.
                       Call Stack: View the call hierarchy leading to the current point of execution.
                       Autos and Locals Windows: Automatically display variable values in the current scope.
                        Exception Handling: Catch and handle exceptions effectively.
                             Using these tools:

                                Set Breakpoints:
                                 Click in the left margin next to a line of code to set a breakpoint.
                                Start Debugging:
                                  Press F5 to start debugging. The program will pause at breakpoints.
                                Inspect Variables:
                                  Hover over variables or use the Watch, Autos, and Locals windows to view values.
                                Step Through Code:
                                   Use F10 (Step Over) and F11 (Step Into) to navigate through the code.
                                Fix Issues:
